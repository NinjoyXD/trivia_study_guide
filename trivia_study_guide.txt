== Intro ==
Hey how's it going. This guide here is a futile attempt to get every #trivia question down on paper in an easy to digest format. Use your computer's find (ctrl/cmd + f) function to find questions quickly.

There is sometimes more than one answer to some questions in the trivia, but the fastest answers are listed so players can save time. For the questions whose answers can be typed in similar speeds, those questions are listed in the "trivia about #trivia" at the bottom of this file.

Questions are generally sorted by game progression and relevance.

Syntax:
Major sections are separated by = bars. As sections go down, they are styled as follows:

* Point placements:
100 -> 50 -> 25 -> 13 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ???
(You get cooldown no matter the placement.)

* You start seeing multiple repeat questions in #trivia once you go back a full week. Going back even farther reveals more.

* On July 13th, 2019, the Trivia guide bot posted the question "3 y-o". The answer was never found, and the question timed out. It was later rumored that the trivia team was editing the bot during that time and this caused the infamous 3 y-o to show up.

* If the channel locked before you could send your answer and you're on PC, press Ctrl+A quickly at the start of the next question to remove the text.

* Fallen Stars can used to craft which block? [sic]

* What is fastest melee weapon in the game? [sic]

* Nane a pre-Hardmode item that allows you to move freely through water with no speed penalty. [sic]

* Trivia times out after 4 minutes and 30 seconds with the message "Trivia question was not answered in time!".

* The truffle is the only NPC (so far) that has two name questions.
** Enoki, Morel, and Porcini are possible names of which NPC?
** Abibe, Konah, and U'wa are possible names of which NPC?

* You can use tr!toggletriviarole in #trivia, and you won't get an X on your answer. It's better to use #bot-commands though, otherwise as you have to wait 5 minutes for a small window to toggle a notification you will have missed.

* Logic gate questions are solved by calculating (on lamps/total lamps). If you're good at fast division you should excel at them.

* "How many dye ingredients in total are needed to craft one Rainbow Dye?" (9) can be remembered as the combinations of the three flame dyes.

=== Bad Answers ===
* For "What in-game time does a world start at after being loaded for the first time?", you must specify 8:15 am. This was an older question updated in the October Update.

* For "Which pre-Hardmode mount performs the best in water?", "hardy saddle" does not work.

* For "Which fishing pole can catch fish in lava?", "hotline" does not work.

* For "Which item can be crafted with Pumpkins by hand?", "Pumpkin work bench" requires the space.

* For "Which storage item doesn't need to be placed in order to function?", "piggy bank" does not work.

* For "What is the Crimson variant of wood?", "shade" does not work.

* For "Which armor set grants you the ability to dash?" (solar flare), "solar" does not work.

* For "What is the only invasion event in which you are attacked by humans?", "pirate" does not work.

=== Alternate Answers ===
* "Mythril Ore and Orichalcum Ore spawn below what depth on a large world? Answer in either feet or tiles." accepts 1000 or 2000.

* "Which leg armor piece provides the largest increase to minion damage?" does not require   the full name, just "red riding" works.

* "Name a quest fish that is named after an real fish, and visually resembles the fish it is named after." accepts 'clownfish' or 'angelfish'.

* For the question "Name one of the 3 pickaxes with the weakest pickaxe power that can mine Luminite ore.", copper may be more iconic, but "tin" is faster.

* When you see "Name one of the 2 debuffs that all slimes are immune to." you may want to type poisoned, but all enemies immune to poisoned are also immune to venom. Type "venom" instead, it's shorter.

* For the question regarding naming a pair of wings from 1.1, you may want to consider typing "demon" instead of "angel". You can mistype "angel" as "angle" easily, and the characters in "demon" are closer together on a qwerty keyboard.

* For "What is the average start depth of the caverns on a large world? Answer in either feet or tiles.", you can answer 480 or 960. 960 is smooth movement from left to right, but 480 is two-handed. Choose which works best for you.

* For "Name one of the 2 fish used to craft the Inferno Potion.", you can answer "flarefin koi" (12) or "obsidifish" (10). While obisdifish is shorter, it requires a reach for the "b" key on a qwerty keyboard. Choose what works best for you.

* For "Name an item that can prevent fall damage from the Stoned debuff.", you can answer djinn's curse or featherfall potion. Obviously djinn's curse is shorter, but if you have trouble typing that, featherfall potion is something to fall back on.

* For "What is the drop rate of the Brain Scrambler?", you can type 1/100 if reaching for shift-5 is difficult.

* "Which debuff do flares inflict?" and "Which debuff does lava inflict?" do not require you to type the "!" from "On Fire!".

* "Which buff do sunflowers give when within a 50-tile radius of the player?" does not require you to type the "!" from "Happy!"

* For "Excluding obsidian, name a type of ore that the Spelunker Potion does not work on.", you can type either hellstone, obsidian, demonite, crimtane, or luminite. Choose what works best for you.

* For "Name one of the three debuffs that prevent all player movement.", stoned, webbed, and frozen all have 6 letters.

* For "Name one of the 2 magic weapons the Moon Lord can drop upon being defeated.", lunar flare does not require you to reach for the p (last prism), potentially saving time.

* "Golden creatures sell for how much gold?" does not require you to specify "10g". "10" is enough. In fact, this appears to be the only question that does this.

* The popular answer to "Name an Underground Crimson enemy that can move through blocks." is "floaty gross", but "crimson axe" saves 1 character, and prevents players from needing to reach both a t and y in the middle of the keyboard.
